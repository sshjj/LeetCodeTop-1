/*
191. Number of 1 Bits
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and return the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

 

Example 1:

Input: 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.

//解决思路：遍历但低效。 //利用性质n&(n-1)=0


//代码
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int i=0;
        while(n!=0){
            n=n&(n-1);
            i++;
        }
        return i;
    }
